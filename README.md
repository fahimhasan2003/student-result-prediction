# 🎓 Student Result Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This is a beginner-level **Machine Learning Project** using Python.  
The project predicts whether a student will **PASS** or **FAIL** based on:
- Hours studied
- Class attendance (%)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Simple dataset (`student_data.csv`)
- Logistic Regression model
- Accuracy calculation
- Visualization with Seaborn & Matplotlib
- New student prediction example

---

## 📊 Dataset Example
| hours_studied | attendance | result |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| 2             | 60         | 0 (Fail) |
| 6             | 80         | 1 (Pass) |
| 9             | 92         | 1 (Pass) |
